    ## Who can use this API

    This API can be used by developers of clinical systems that support clinicians delivering direct care. It is a patient-facing API.

    ## Prerequisites

    Information governance (IG)

    You must:

    be compliant with the GP Connect Direct Care API Information Governance Model
    manage access to your system locally using local role-based access control (RBAC). This does not need to be compliant with the national RBAC model and GP Connect products do not require smartcards to control access, though they can be used if already implementedbe using the GP Connect APIs for direct care purposes for NHS patients in England

    Clinical safety

    You must:

    - have a clinical safety officer (CSO) who is responsible for DCB0129 and, if necessary, DCB0160. For more on clinical risk management, visit Clinical risk management standards.

    If you are confident that you can meet the prerequisites, contact us to express your interest. See 'Onboarding' below.

    This API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis), meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.

    ## The end user must be:
